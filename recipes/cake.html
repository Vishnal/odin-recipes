        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Choose your favourite filling for this easy, perfectly fluffy sponge cake – we've opted for lemon curd and whipped cream, but you could have jam. Perfect for afternoon tea.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>225g softened butter</li>
            <li>225g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>Optional fillings of lemon curd, jam, lightly whipped cream</li>
            <li>icing sugar for dusting</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, butter and line the base of two 20cm spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the lemon zest, vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined then divide the mixture between the two tins.</li>
            <li>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Fill how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3 days.</li>
