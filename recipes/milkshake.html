            <li>Load the back of a teaspoon with a little of the chocolate spread and spread it in a long line from the bottom of the inside of the glass to the top.

            <li>Top with a layer of the marshmallows and a spoonful of whipped cream. Decorate with a drizzle of the warmed chocolate spread and a few toasted hazelnuts. Serve immediately with a straw.</li>
